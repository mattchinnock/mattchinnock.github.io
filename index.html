            mostly self-contained blocks of functionality that will be broken down into smaller subtasks, or “Issues”.
            Each issue is a well defined piece of work, with a clear discription, acceptance criteria and test criteria that can easily
             be picked up and worked on with minimal explaination needed. These issues are placed in a list, in order of priority
             decided by the Product Owner. At the end of each Sprint, the backlog is revisted.

            to be documented. Design a workflow that is repeatable and accessible to the entire team. All team members should be

            Following Agile best practices, the team goes through a section of the backlog to assign story points to issues. Every team member
            has input, ensuring that the issues selected for a Sprint are reasonable in terms of effort, and each issue is clearly defined.
            Every day during development, the team meets briefly to discuss it's progress and any potential problems. After the Sprint has finished,
            work is tested by the QA team before being deployed. Each sprint should leave the Product owner with functional, usable code.

                Valence is an integration framework built natively in Salesforce. It radically reduces the time needed to build
                integrations between Salesforce and other systems, and empowers Admins when it comes to data synchronization.

                A large part of my services work at KapuHonu invloved connecting systems together. Valence is an incarnation of the experience gained
                from building these custom intregrations over and over. It provides an extensive and extensible platform to help admins, developers and execs
                connect their Salesforce orgs to any REST based system without having to spend the time, money and effort that comes with a completely bespoke solution.

              <p>
                "Lead Marketplace"* is a Salesforce based app that collects, sanitises and standardises Leads (information about prospective customers).
                This data is initally gathered from multiple sources in varying formats, filtered, cleaned up and offered to the end user as a servicable group.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Project Description</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                Built using the robust Data Model of Salesforce, the marketplace utilises external integrations with systems such as Heroku and Elesticsearch for large scale data
                computation that standardises the data for consumption. Once Leads have entered the system, the end user has a myriad of tools available to view, edit and manage the Leads.
                The Lead aquisition process is recorded at every step, offering performance analysis and process efficiency improvements at every interaction.
              </p>

                <strong>Role</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                 As a developer on this project I was one of two responsible for the UI design. On top of that, writing Visualforce and Apex code providing the frontend
                 with real-time updates to Lead information through Dashboards, charts and cards. I also implemented a CTI (telephony), allowing users to call Leads directly from
                 their record in the application through a custom built Softphone.

              <p>
                With one moving part, Akoona ice machines produce an unlimited supply of fresh filtered ice and water
                while using only 15 percent of the energy used by traditional methods. The web-based monitoring system tracks
                power, water, plastic bag supply and transactions, and alerts the operator remotely to any issues with
                production, quality control or servicing.

                <strong>Project Description</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                The Akoona platform was designed to remotely manage ice machines located around the world.
                 Using a php based frontend, technicians could diagnose hardware problems before they took the trip
                 out to the machine, allowing for more efficient repairs and allowing them to take care of issues before they
                 occurred.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Role</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                 As a developer on this project I managed onboarding of new device types, allowing the user to issue commands
                 and see the status of machines through the php based interface.

              <p>
                I haved worked extensively with non-profit groups over the course of my carreer, allowing me the opportunity
                to participate in projects directly focused on improving the lives of others. The Sullivan Foundation,
                an example of one such group, is a charitable organization formed by the New York legislature with the mission of supporting
                education, maintenance, care and training of children of any age and circumstance. The Foundation provides scholarships to rising
                juniors at 31 colleges and universities, and presents annual awards to graduating seniors at 61 institutions.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Project Description</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                As with most non profits, keeping track of people is integral to the Sullivan Foundation. As Project Lead, I owned the
                building, the maintenance and the expansion of their Salesforce Org in order to help them track students and schools.
                In addition, I oversaw the development of a custom event management system that allowed Sullivan to plan,
                manage and execute events across the country. This included a Salesforce integration to Eventbrite that moved ticket and
                attendee information between systems, keeping the CRM up to date with prospective and active Leads. Finally, I developed
                an invoicing system inside of Salesforce that allowed for schools to be invoiced automatically at the end of each event,
                saving hundreds of man hours per event.
